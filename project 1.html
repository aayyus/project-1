<h1 align="center"> <i>Beware of password hackers and crackers!</i></h1>
<hr color="cyan">


<p align="just">The threat of hackers and crackers is for real, and is alike for everything for everyone. If the
   security breach at the Babha Atomic Research Center last year by the hacker group milworm didn’t convince you of
   their capabilities, then consider this: James Davis aka jdavis_a, a resident of
   www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bit/2483 homestead community on the Internet, might just be reading your e-mail in
   your mailbox right now, or using your account for some benign Internet surfing, or exchanging it with someone else on
   the Net for more such accounts!
   Surprised? Or scared?
